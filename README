  Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions, particularly if
you are installing on a non-Linux machine.

  This is a handy little utility to display a tree view of directories that
I wrote some time ago and just added color support to.  I've decided that
since no one else has done something similar I would go ahead and release
it, even though it's barely a 1st year CS student hack.  I've found it damn
handy to peruse a directory tree though, especially when someone is trying to
hide something from you.

  The main distribution site for tree is here:
