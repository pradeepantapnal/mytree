Tree installation instructions
==============================

This source tree includes a small Makefile used to build the `tree`
executable.  The build process is largely the same on most Unix like
systems.

Building on Linux
-----------------
Simply run `make` in the source directory.  This produces the `tree`
binary which can be installed with `make install` (you may need root
permissions).

Building on macOS or BSD
------------------------
The Makefile also works with Clang.  Ensure the development tools are
installed and invoke `make`.  You can specify the compiler explicitly
with `make CC=clang` if required.

Cross compilation and other toolchains
--------------------------------------
All compiler and linker tools are prefixed by the `TOOLSPREFIX`
variable in the Makefile.  To use a different toolchain, set this
variable when invoking `make`:

    make TOOLSPREFIX=aarch64-linux-gnu-

Setting `TOOLSPREFIX` to an empty string builds with the host's default
compilers.  This mechanism allows cross compiling for targets such as
Windows using mingw, for example:

    make TOOLSPREFIX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-

Cleaning
--------
Run `make clean` to remove intermediate objects and the `tree` binary.
